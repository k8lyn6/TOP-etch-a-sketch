# Etch-A-Sketch

This project allows the user to draw on an Etch-A-Sketch in either grayscale or color. The user can choose the size of the pixels by choosing the number of rows on the screen.

Although this project is mostly JavaScript, I learned _a lot_ about CSS. I think I have a better understanding of how elements appear on a page and how to manipulate them, both using CSS and JavaScript. In the future, I'd like to fix the button functionality to allow the user to clear the screen separately from changing the size and color.
